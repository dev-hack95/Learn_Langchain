      "1. **Creation**: A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime, while a thread is an operating system-level entity managed directly by the OS. Creating a goroutine is much faster than creating a thread because the Go runtime manages the underlying thread pool.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Stack size**: Each goroutine has its own stack of fixed size (1KB to 1MB), while threads have larger stacks that are managed by the OS. Goroutines share the same OS thread when they run in the same OS thread context, and therefore share the same stack with other goroutines in that context.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Context switching**: Goroutine context switching is much faster than thread context switching because the Go runtime only needs to switch between managed data structures, while thread context switching involves saving and restoring the entire thread state on the OS level.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Memory management**: Go manages memory automatically for both goroutines and threads. However, since goroutines share the same heap memory, they can easily communicate and share data through pointers. Threads, being independent entities managed by the OS, may require explicit inter-thread communication mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Scheduling**: Goroutines are scheduled by the Go runtime based on their priority levels and the availability of CPU resources. Threads, on the other hand, are scheduled by the operating system based on various factors like priority levels, IO operations, etc.\n",
      "\n",
