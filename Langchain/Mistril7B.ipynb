In the context of digital signals and images, this means reducing the number of bits used to represent each sample or pixel. Bit quantization refers specifically to the reduction in the number of bits used to represent the intensity or color information of each pixel in an image. This can be done by rounding off the original floating-point values to the nearest integer value that can be represented using the reduced number of bits. The result is a compressed version of the original image, with a lower bit depth and therefore lower resolution and dynamic range compared to the original.
