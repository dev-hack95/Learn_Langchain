       "'Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in quantum physics where two or more particles become linked together in such a way that their quantum states are dependent on each other. This means that the properties of one particle, such as its position, momentum, or polarization, are intrinsically connected to the properties of the other particle(s), regardless of the distance between them.\\n\\nThe concept was first introduced by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen in 1935 to challenge certain aspects of quantum mechanics. They proposed the \"EPR Paradox\" (named after their initials), which suggested that quantum mechanics might be incomplete or that there were hidden variables determining the properties of entangled particles.\\n\\nHowever, subsequent experiments have confirmed the reality of quantum entanglement. For example, the famous Bell\\'s theorem and subsequent Bell tests have demonstrated that entangled particles exhibit correlations that cannot be explained by classical physics or local hidden variables.\\n\\nQuantum entanglement has several intriguing characteristics. Firstly, the entangled particles can be separated by large distances and still exhibit instantaneous correlations, seemingly violating the speed of light limit. This property is called \"spooky action at a distance,\" a term coined by Einstein.\\n\\nSecondly, when the state of one entangled particle is measured, it \"collapses\" into a particular value, and simultaneously, the state of the other entangled particle(s) also collapses instantaneously, regardless of the distance between them. This feature is often referred to as \"non-locality.\"\\n\\nQuantum entanglement plays a crucial role in various applications of quantum information science. For example, it forms the basis of quantum teleportation, where the quantum state of one particle can be transferred to another distant particle without physical transmission of the particle itself. It is also relevant in quantum cryptography, as any attempt to tamper with an entangled state would be immediately detected due to its fragile nature.\\n\\nOverall, quantum entanglement is a fundamental concept in quantum theory, highlighting the peculiar and non-intuitive nature of the quantum world and providing the basis for various quantum technologies.'"
