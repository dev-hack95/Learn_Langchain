      "\n",
      "Background Information:\n",
      "\n",
      "HMM (Hidden Markov Model) is a Stochastic technique for POS tagging. Hidden Markov models are known for their applications to reinforcement learning and temporal pattern recognition such as speech, handwriting, gesture recognition, musical score following, partial discharges, and bioinformatics.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are various techniques that can be used for POS tagging such as: \n",
      "\n",
      "Rule-based POS tagging: The rule-based POS tagging models apply a set of handwritten rules and use contextual information to assign POS tags to words. These rules are often known as context frame rules. One such rule might be: “If an ambiguous/unknown word ends with the suffix ‘ing’ and is preceded by a Verb, label it as a Verb”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Transformation Based Tagging:  The transformation-based approaches use a pre-defined set of handcrafted rules as well as automatically induced rules that are generated during training.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deep learning models: Various Deep learning models have been used for POS tagging such as Meta-BiLSTM which have shown an impressive accuracy of around 97 percent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stochastic (Probabilistic) tagging: A stochastic approach includes frequency, probability or statistics. The simplest stochastic approach finds out the most frequently used tag for a specific word in the annotated training data and uses this information to tag that word in the unannotated text. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states—called the Viterbi path—that results in a sequence of observed events, especially in the context of Markov information sources and hidden Markov models (HMM).\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s delve into the practical applications of HMM-based POS tagging:\n",
      "\n",
      "Speech Recognition: When we use voice assistants like Siri or Google Assistant to dictate “I’m reading a lead story,” it’s crucial for the system to correctly identify “lead” as a noun (a primary news article) rather than its verb form (to guide). Here, HMM-based POS tagging plays a pivotal role in ensuring such distinctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Machine Translation: Let’s say we’re translating the English phrase “I read books” into French. It becomes essential for tools like Google Translate to figure out if “read” is present or past tense. By employing HMM-based POS tagging, we aid the system in making this crucial determination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Text-to-Speech Systems: Let’s picture an app that vocalizes written content. In a sentence like “The wind is too intense to wind the clock,” the role of HMMs in POS tagging becomes evident as they help the system pronounce the two instances of “wind” appropriately.\n",
      "\n",
