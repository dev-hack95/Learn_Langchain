       "\"Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in quantum physics where two or more particles become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle cannot be described independently of the other(s), regardless of the distance between them. In other words, the properties of entangled particles are interconnected and any change in one particle instantaneously affects the other(s), regardless of the distance between them.\\n\\nThis concept was first introduced by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen in their famous EPR paradox thought experiment. Quantum entanglement challenges the classical notion of locality, suggesting that information can be transmitted faster than the speed of light, which is counter to the principles of special relativity.\\n\\nEntangled particles can be generated through various methods, such as the decay of a particle into two entangled daughter particles or through interactions in a controlled laboratory setup. Once entangled, the particles exhibit specific quantum mechanical correlations, such as their spin, polarization, or position. These correlations are preserved even if the particles are separated by vast distances.\\n\\nQuantum entanglement has been experimentally observed and verified through various experiments, including the violation of Bell's inequalities. It is the foundation for various applications in quantum information processing, such as quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography, and quantum computing.\""
