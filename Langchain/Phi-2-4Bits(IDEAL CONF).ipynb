This can have significant advantages when it comes to transmitting data over long distances (like over the Internet) or storing large amounts of information without consuming too much power/costs (as in storing data on disk drives). Additionally, because there’s no need for any other types of processing besides conversion from float32s into integer8s, bit-quantized signals are often faster than their analog counterparts.\n",

By compressing the video stream using these techniques, it’s possible to store more information into less space without losing quality.
